First, an update & publish job, which updates the version in the package's root __init__.py file through an Invoke task. The newly created tag (created due to the caller workflow running on.release.types.published ) will be updated accordingly, as will the publish branch (defaults to main ). Secondly, a job to update the documentation is run, however, this can be deactivated. The job expects the documentation to be setup with the mike + MkDocs + GitHub Pages framework. For more information about the specific changelog inputs, see the related changelog generator actually used, specifically the list of configuration options . Note Concerning the changelog generator, the specific input changelog_exclude_labels defaults to a list of different labels if not supplied, hence, if supplied, one might want to include these labels alongside any extra labels. The default value is given here as a help: 'duplicate,question,invalid,wontfix' The changelog_exclude_tags_regex is also used to remove tags in a list of tags to consider when evaluating the \"previous version\". This is specifically for adding a changelog to the GitHub release body. Updating instances of version in repository files \u00b6 The content of repository files can be updated to use the new version where necessary. This is done through the version_update_changes (and version_update_changes_separator ) inputs. To see an example of how to use the version_update_changes (and version_update_changes_separator ) see for example the workflow used by the SINTEF/ci-cd repository calling the CD Release workflow. Some notes to consider and respect when using version_update_changes are: The value of version_update_changes_separator applies to all lines given in version_update_changes , meaning it should be a character, or series of characters, which will not be part of the actual content. Specifically, concerning the 'raw' Python string 'pattern' the following applies: Always escape double quotes ( \" ). This is done by prefixing it with a backslash ( \\ ): \\\" . Escape special bash/sh characters, e.g., back tick ( ` ). Escape special Python regular expression characters, if they are not used for their intended purpose in this 'raw' string. See the re library documentation for more information. Concerning the 'replacement string' part, the package_dir input and full semantic version can be substituted in dynamically by wrapping either package_dir or version in curly braces ( {} ). Indeed, for the version, one can specify sub-parts of the version to use, e.g., if one desires to only use the major version, this can be done by using the major attribute: {version.major} . The full list of version attributes are: major , minor , patch , pre_release , and build . More can be used, e.g., to only insert the major.minor version: {version.major}.{version.minor} . For the 'file path' part, package_dir wrapped in curly braces ( {} ) will also be substituted at run time with the package_dir input. E.g., {package_dir}/__init__.py will become ci_cd/__init__.py if the package_dir input was 'ci_cd' . Expectations \u00b6 This workflow should only be used for releasing a single modern Python package. The repository contains the following: ( required ) A Python package root __init__.py file with __version__ defined. ( required ) The workflow is run for a tag that starts with v followed by a full semantic version. This will automatically be the case for a GitHub release, which creates a new tag that starts with v . See SemVer.org for more information about semantic versioning. Inputs \u00b6 Name Description Required Default Type git_username A git username (used to set the 'user.name' config option). Yes string git_email A git user's email address (used to set the 'user.email' config option). Yes string python_package Whether or not this is a Python package, where the version should be updated in the 'package_dir'/__init__.py and a build and release to PyPI should be performed. No true boolean package_dir Path to the Python package directory relative to the repository directory. Example: 'src/my_package' . Important : This is required if 'python_package' is 'true', which is the default. Yes (if 'python_package' is 'true' string release_branch The branch name to release/publish from. No main string install_extras Any extras to install from the local repository through 'pip'. Must be encapsulated in square parentheses ( [] ) and be separated by commas ( , ) without any spaces. Example: '[dev,release]' . No Empty string string python_version The Python version to use for the workflow. No 3.9 string version_update_changes A single or multi-line string of changes to be implemented in the repository files upon updating the version. The string should be made up of three parts: 'file path', 'pattern', and 'replacement string'. These are separated by the 'version_update_changes_separator' value. The 'file path' must always either be relative to the repository root directory or absolute. The 'pattern' should be given as a 'raw' Python string. No Empty string string version_update_changes_separator The separator to use for 'version_update_changes' when splitting the three parts of each string. No , string build_cmd The package build command, e.g., 'pip install flit && flit build' or 'python -m build' (default). No python -m build string tag_message_file Relative path to a release tag message file from the root of the repository. Example: '.github/utils/release_tag_msg.txt' . No Empty string string publish_on_pypi Whether or not to publish on PyPI. Note : This is only relevant if 'python_package' is 'true', which is the default. No true boolean test Whether to use the TestPyPI repository index instead of PyPI. No false boolean update_docs Whether or not to also run the 'docs' workflow job. No false boolean doc_extras Any extras to install from the local repository through 'pip'. Must be encapsulated in square parentheses ( [] ) and be separated by commas ( , ) without any spaces. Note, if this is empty, 'install_extras' will be used as a fallback. Example: '[docs]' . No Empty string string changelog_exclude_tags_regex A regular expression matching any tags that should be excluded from the CHANGELOG.md. No Empty string string changelog_exclude_labels Comma-separated list of labels to exclude from the CHANGELOG.md. No Empty string string Secrets \u00b6 Name Description Required PyPI_token A PyPI token for publishing the built package to PyPI. Important : This is required if both 'python_package' and 'publish_on_pypi' are 'true'. Both are 'true' by default.

The default value is given here as a help: 'duplicate,question,invalid,wontfix' The changelog_exclude_tags_regex is also used to remove tags in a list of tags to consider when evaluating the \"previous version\".

This is done through the version_update_changes (and version_update_changes_separator ) inputs. To see an example of how to use the version_update_changes (and version_update_changes_separator ) see for example the workflow used by the SINTEF/ci-cd repository calling the CD Release workflow. Some notes to consider and respect when using version_update_changes are: The value of version_update_changes_separator applies to all lines given in version_update_changes , meaning it should be a character, or series of characters, which will not be part of the actual content. Specifically, concerning the 'raw' Python string 'pattern' the following applies: Always escape double quotes ( \" ). This is done by prefixing it with a backslash ( \\ ): \\\" . Escape special bash/sh characters, e.g., back tick ( ` ). Escape special Python regular expression characters, if they are not used for their intended purpose in this 'raw' string. See the re library documentation for more information. Concerning the 'replacement string' part, the package_dir input and full semantic version can be substituted in dynamically by wrapping either package_dir or version in curly braces ( {} ). Indeed, for the version, one can specify sub-parts of the version to use, e.g., if one desires to only use the major version, this can be done by using the major attribute: {version.major} . The full list of version attributes are: major , minor , patch , pre_release , and build . More can be used, e.g., to only insert the major.minor version: {version.major}.{version.minor} . For the 'file path' part, package_dir wrapped in curly braces ( {} ) will also be substituted at run time with the package_dir input. E.g., {package_dir}/__init__.py will become ci_cd/__init__.py if the package_dir input was 'ci_cd' .","title":"Updating instances of version in repository files"},{"location":"workflows/cd_release/#expectations","text":"This workflow should only be used for releasing a single modern Python package.

No Empty string string Run pylint & safety \u00b6 Run the pylint and/or safety tools. The pylint tool can be run in different ways. Either it is run once and the pylint_targets is a required input, while pylint_options is a single- or multi-line optional input. Or pylint_runs is used, a single- or multi-line input, to explicitly write out all pylint options and target(s) one line at a time. For each line in pylint_runs , pylint will be executed. Using pylint_runs is useful if you have a section of your code, which should be run with a custom set of options, otherwise it is recommended to instead simply use the pylint_targets and optionally also pylint_options inputs. The safety tool checks all installed Python packages, hence the install_extras input should be given as to install all possible dependencies.
